1-copy the svn ile into Program(x86) directory
	C:\Program Files (x86)

2-Set the class path

3-we want our root directory be named as c:\svnroot. Then, create this directory either in command prompt or using Explorer.

4-Create repositories in the svn root directories using the following commands:
	svnadmin create c:\svnroot\test1
	svnadmin create c:\svnroot\test2
5-copy the Appache24 folder to c:/ drive

6- install the very recent visual c++ (2017) 

7-install the Appache24 using following command in cmd
	httpd -k install

8- Now to configure your server. Inside the Apache24 folder is a conf folder, 
with a file called httpd.conf. 
That is the main configuration file. 
Open it in a text editor as you'll need to make a handful of edits:

ServerRoot
Find the line that starts with ServerRoot (approximately line 37). Change it to:

	ServerRoot "C:/Program Files/Apache24"

ServerName
Find the line that contains ServerName (approximately line 217).
 Remove the pound sign (#) that precedes it. Then change it to:

	ServerName localhost:8080

9- type http://localhost:8080

10- go to the bin directory within the Subversion installation, 
find two files with extension *.so, and put them into the (Apache)/modules directory. 
The files are mod_authz_svn.so and mod_dav_svn.so.

11- Go to the conf sub-directory within the Apache installation directory and open the httpd.conf file in any text editor.

Add the following lines:


	LoadModule dav_module modules/mod_dav.so
	LoadModule dav_svn_module modules/mod_dav_svn.so
	LoadModule authz_svn_module modules/mod_authz_svn.so

12- After that, add the following block:

<Location /svn/>
    DAV svn
    SVNParentPath c:/svnroot/ #specify the root for repositories
    #http://www.archivesat.com/CVS_developers_help/thread45479.htm 
        post which discuss why you need to specify /svn/ and not /svn
    
    #list repositories
    SVNListParentPath on 
    # our access control policy
    AuthzSVNAccessFile bin/apachesvnauth #authentication file 
                   #path where policy is written for each user   

    AuthType Basic #type of authentication
    AuthName "Subversion repository" #the name of the authentication 
                                      #and the name of repository realm
    AuthUserFile bin/apachesvnpasswd #the name of the 
                                      #file with user passwords values
    Require valid-user #permit to log-in only for authorized users
</Location>

<Location /svn/> - if you type in your browser something like this: http://localhost:8080/svn/, then Apache will know how to find your root repository using SVNParentPath.
SVNParentPath c:/svnroot/ - specify the root for the repositories.
SVNListParentPath on - permit to see the list of repositories using http://localhost:8080/svn/.
AuthzSVNAccessFile bin/apachesvnauth - authentication file path where the policy is provided for each user. The file is stored in the bin sub-directory of Apache.
AuthType Basic - the type of authentication.
AuthName "Subversion repository" - the name of the authentication and the name of the repository realm.
AuthUserFile bin/apachesvnpasswd - the name of the file with user password values, stored in the bin subdirectory of the Apache installation.
Require valid-user - permit to log-in only for authorized users.

13- Building the password file

We use the AuthUserFile bin/apachesvnpasswd entry, 
which tells Apache to find the file with passwords in the bin sub-directory 
within the Apache installation directory. We need to build this file. 
Go to that directory using the command prompt and type the following command:


htpasswd.exe -c apachesvnpasswd user1

You will be prompted to enter the password for user user1, 
and the file apachesvnpasswd will be created in the bin sub-directory. 
In order to add another user, just type the same command without -c and 
provide the name of another user.


htpasswd.exe -c apachesvnpasswd user2

Note: only the users we created will be able to log into our repositories 
because we used the Require valid-user parameter.

14- Building the authentication file

The following block is an example of the authentication file:

Hide   Copy Code
[/] * = r [test1:/] user1 = rw user2 = [test2:/] user1 = r user2 = rw
Explanations

[/] * = r - gives access to everyone to read all the repositories
[test1:/] - gives read and write permissions to user1 for repository test1, and user2 can not read or write
[test2:/] - user1 can read from repository test2, and user2 has full access rights

15- Run Apache

Theoretically, we are at the stage when we can run Apache and test our Subversion. 
So start Apache, open the web browser and write something like this: http://localhost:8080/svn/.

If you don't get any errors, you will be prompted to type the username and password.
